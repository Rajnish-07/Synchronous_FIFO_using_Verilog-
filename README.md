# Synchronous FIFO using Verilog

This repository implements a **Synchronous FIFO (First In First Out) buffer** using Verilog HDL.  
A FIFO is a commonly used memory structure that buffers data, synchronizes flow, and preserves input order, making it essential in digital systems such as data communication, pipelining, and real-time processing.

---

## Description

This FIFO design operates under a single clock domain (synchronous), using the same clock for both read and write operations. The FIFO supports:

- Write operations when `wr_en` is high and FIFO is not full
- Read operations when `rd_en` is high and FIFO is not empty

The waveform demonstrates the expected FIFO behavior:

> Initially `empty` → data written sequentially → FIFO becomes `full` → data read out → FIFO returns to `empty`

---

## Core Functionality

- Write Operation:
  - Data is written when `wr_en = 1` and `full = 0`
  - Write pointer (`wr_ptr`) increments on successful write

- Read Operation:
  - Data is read when `rd_en = 1` and `empty = 0`
  - Read pointer (`rd_ptr`) increments on successful read

---

## Full & Empty Logic

- Empty Condition:
  ```verilog
  empty = (wr_ptr == rd_ptr); // MSB and LSB both equal
Full Condition:
full = (wr_ptr[MSB] != rd_ptr[MSB]) &&
       (wr_ptr[LSBs] == rd_ptr[LSBs]);
